## About Project
This week's group project is to build our own accessible & responsive clone of the DuckDuckGo home page (long version).  Visually to our site should be identical to the real DuckDuckGo.

## Blocked
1. We face block in responsive height in section.
2. The place of images in the button of the sections.
3. We have a lot of conflicts when we merge the branches. 

## Tips
1. Next time we should make a meeting at the beginning of the project because we want to put outlines about the project such as the name of folders, ids classes. 
2. When we want to push our files we don't want to push all the code but only our parts if we work in the same file to reduce conflicts.
3. We are open to listen to coaches' advice.
